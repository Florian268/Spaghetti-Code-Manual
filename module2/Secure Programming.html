   <h3>Secure Programming</h3>
  <h6> Another subset of defensive programming is secure programming. In this form of
    defensive programming, the primary concern is security. So the program may be allowed to fail in
    certain ways, the goal is to avoid bugs or errors that could be exploited maliciously. </h6>

    <h3>In Conclusion...</h3>
    <h6>There are multiple approaches to defensive design in programming. Each having its advanatges and
      drawbacks. As the programmer, it is up to you to decide which method best suits your goal, and to balance
      the pros and cons of said method.</h6>
