# Online Training Manuals

This repository will allow you to create a mobile-first training manual. The interactive wireframe follows branch logic to move the user through each of the three modules based on user selection.

Open each file to add content. Mix and match div. blocks to build quickly. All of the design elements you need are embedded in the document. We've also provided hidden comments to help guide you through the process. 

We recommend you begin with one of our starter programs before using this one. 

    
    
##Get started!


1. Go to Training Manual [repository](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/training-manual) 

2. Click "Code" then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. Use the text editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

9. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

10. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

11. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
