            <h2 style="text-align: center;">What Are UML Diagrams</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">UML, or Unified Modeling Language, diagrams model and document software. There exists several different types of these diagrams. In this section, we will go over some of the most popular types of diagrams and how you can implement them into your coding endevors.</p>
        <h2 style= "text-align: center;">How They Help Spaghetti Code</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">UML diagrams help visualize the more difficult and abstract parts of coding. New programmers may find it difficult to keep all the architecture of their software organized, especially if it involves several types of different classes that interact. So, a visual representation allows programmers to keep all of their structure straight, as well as be able to share with others how their system works.</p>
